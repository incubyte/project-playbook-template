## The why of this call

To understand what makes you (the business / client) tick, what are our high level goals, understand what are the pain points and how Incubyte can help in achieving that goal.

## Impact mapping exercise

### What is impact mapping?

Impact mapping is a lightweight, collaborative planning technique for teams that want to make a big impact with software products.
Impact maps help delivery teams and stakeholders visualise roadmaps, explain how deliverables connect to user needs, and communicate how user outcomes relate to higher level organisational goals.

### Why use Impact Mapping?

Impact mapping is fast, visual and collaborative. It makes it easy to engage people from various roles and backgrounds, expose hidden assumptions and document important decisions. It provides just enough structure to facilitate effective planning and prioritisation, but does not get in the way with complicated syntax or bureaucracy.
