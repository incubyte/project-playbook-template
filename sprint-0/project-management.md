# Project Management Setup

## Least Process Heavy Approach

Strive for a lean and efficient project management approach. Embrace simplicity to avoid unnecessary overhead, meetings and documentation.

## The Shortest Possible Sprint and Smallest Possible Swimlanes

Opt for shorter sprint durations and smaller work units within swimlanes to enhance focus, adaptability and responsiveness.

-   Consider [shorter sprint durations](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/sprint-length-why-two-weeks) (e.g., two weeks) to maintain a rapid development pace.
-   Divide work into [smaller swimlanes](https://www.planview.com/resources/guide/agile-glossary/#swimlane) for enhanced visibility and manageable tasks.

## Strive Towards Least WIP (Work in Progress)

Limit the amount of work in progress to improve throughput and minimize multitasking.

## Boards

Use visual boards to track and manage work items effectively.

-   Set up [Kanban boards](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) for continuous flow and visualization of work.
-   Utilize [Scrum boards](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/boards) for sprint-based development and planning.

## Estimation Techniques (Optional)

Consider using estimation techniques to aid your internal team's planning and decision-making.

-   Explore techniques like [Planning Poker](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/how-to-play-planning-poker) for relative estimation.
-   Adopt [T-Shirt sizing](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation) for quick and intuitive size comparisons.

## Sprint

Implement the sprint framework to organize work into focused development cycles.

-   Define sprint goals and outcomes to guide the team's efforts.
-   Conduct sprint planning meetings to select backlog items and plan tasks.

## Start Defining Backlog Items

Begin identifying and defining user stories, features and tasks for your project's backlog.

## PBI / Task Status Definitions Need to Be Concluded Internally

Define clear and agreed-upon status definitions for Product Backlog Items (PBIs) and tasks within your team. This ensures everyone understands the progress and status of work items.

-   Set up a common understanding of terms like "To Do," "In Progress," "Review," and "Done."

By implementing these project management setup practices, you can create a foundation for efficient collaboration, adaptive planning, and effective delivery.
