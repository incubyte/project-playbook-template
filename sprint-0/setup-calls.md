## Backlog grooming

The primary purpose of a backlog grooming session is to ensure the next few sprints worth of user stories in the product backlog are prepared for sprint planning. Regular backlog grooming sessions also help ensure the right stories are prioritized and that the product backlog does not become a black hole

## Sprint planning

The purpose of sprint planning is 1) to select the right set of product backlog items to work on during the sprint and 2) to discuss each item enough to feel confident beginning work.

## Sprint retrospective

A sprint retrospective is a way to bring teams together and plan the best ways to increase quality and effectiveness in regard to people, interactions, processes, tools, and each person‚Äôs definition of done.

### Best practices

-   Retrospective meetings should have well-defined action items for the points to improve
-   Discuss previous action items to make sure there is progress being made on decided upon action items

## Sprint demo

The Sprint Demo should be the most exciting meeting on any team‚Äôs calendar. Why? Because it is the team‚Äôs chance to showcase and celebrate all the hard work they accomplished over the course of a sprint.

During the Sprint Demo, the team demonstrates what they built- typically working, usable software- to get feedback on what they have built so far, demonstrate progress of the build, and gain insight into how they will continue their work in the next sprint based on input, feedback and questions from the meeting.

## Tea or Coffee breaküçµ

Every one needs a break from the routine and have fun by playing games

### Game recommendations

-   Pictionary
