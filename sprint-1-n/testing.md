# Testing

Implement a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the functionality, reliability and quality of your software. Different types of testing are essential at different stages of development:

### Unit Testing

-   Write [unit tests](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/types-of-software-testing#unittesting) for individual components or functions to verify their correctness.

### Integration Testing

-   Perform [integration tests](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/types-of-software-testing#integrationtesting) to validate the interactions between different modules or services.

### Functional Testing

-   Conduct [functional tests](https://www.guru99.com/functional-testing.html) to verify whether the software meets the specified requirements and works as intended.

### End-to-End Testing

-   Implement [end-to-end tests](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/types-of-software-testing#endtoendtesting) to validate the entire flow of your application, often using scenarios that simulate real user interactions.

### Contract testing

-   Contents to be added

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

-   Collaborate with users or stakeholders to perform [user acceptance testing](https://www.guru99.com/user-acceptance-testing.html) to ensure the software meets their expectations.

### Performance Testing

-   Conduct [performance testing](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/performance-testing-tutorial/) to evaluate the responsiveness, stability and scalability of your application under various conditions.

### Security Testing

-   Integrate [security testing](https://www.guru99.com/security-testing.html) to identify vulnerabilities and ensure your software is resistant to potential threats.

### Regression Testing

-   Perform [regression tests](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/types-of-software-testing#regressiontesting) to ensure that new changes haven't introduced unexpected side effects or broken existing functionality.

### Usability Testing

-   Validate the user experience through [usability testing](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/) to ensure your software is user-friendly and intuitive.

### Accessibility Testing

-   Check your software's accessibility by performing [accessibility testing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/) to ensure it can be used by people with disabilities.

### Exploratory Testing

-   Encourage [exploratory testing](https://www.guru99.com/exploratory-testing.html) to uncover defects that might not be covered by scripted tests.

By combining these testing types in your development process, you can identify and address issues at different levels, providing a robust and reliable software product.
