# Making of Successful Independent Pods

### What Are Independent Pods?

Independent Pods are autonomous, cross-functional teams at Incubyte that own an initiative end-to-end. This may be the MVP of a new greenfield product, a new feature, a parallel swimlane in a product roadmap, or a task force focused on solving a specific business problem. Their goal is to operate independently, with high collaboration with the client but low dependencies on them, to ensure agility, efficiency, and ownership, while aligning with Incubyte's guiding principles to deliver high-quality solutions and deliver value fast and frequently. 

Independent Pods, while designed for autonomy, face limitations due to inherent dependencies. They often rely on client input for requirements, feedback, and alignment, which can affect agility. Shared resources, skill gaps, and organizational constraints like governance, compliance, and strategic alignment may also restrict full independence. Coordination with other teams, integration with existing systems, and reliance on third-party tools or services introduce additional dependencies. Balancing independence with these dependencies is crucial for the pod's success. 


### Objective of the Playbook

This playbook provides guidelines to:

-   Spin up an independent pod for clients.
-   Transform it into a high-functioning team.
-   Ensure its long-term success, both for clients and Incubyte.


## Guidelines for Spinning Up an Independent Pod

### Team Topology and Composition
