# Playbook template for making independant pods successful 
This playbook template is a pre-designed framework that provides a standardized format for creating project specific playbooks. Project specific playbook created using this template would act as a one-stop knowledge base for that project. 

### How to use this playbook template

This playbook template serves as a guide for all the things that need to happen in a project eventually and ensures a consistent experience for all our clients. It also ensures that all the projects are using the latest guidelines and best practices. Create a new project specific repository from this template using [this](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
