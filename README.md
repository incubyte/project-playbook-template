# Playbook template for making independant pods successful 
This playbook template is a pre-designed framework that provides a standardized format for creating project specific playbooks. Project specific playbook created using this template would act as a one-stop knowledge base for that project. 

### How to use this playbook template

This playbook template serves as a guide for all the things that need to happen in a project eventually and ensures a consistent experience for all our clients. It also ensures that all the projects are using the latest guidelines and best practices. Create a new project specific repository from this template using [this](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

This playbook template would have TODO Checklist in various sections, make sure to check those boxes once that particular task is completed and put the relevant artifact links in the input fields if required

For example
TODO Checklist:
- [x] Project MIRO Board Prepared [MIRO board artifact](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLy8lmks=/)
- [ ] Kickoff Email Sent

**⚠️ Don't skip a part of the playbook recommendation without proper justification of why something cannot be done/is irrelevant to the client or project.**
