### Detailed Guiding Principles
These are the guiding principles for everything we do at Incubyte, both within and outside of our project work.

The principles that make us who we are:

- [Relentless Pursuit of Quality with Pragmatism](#relentless-pursuit-of-quality-with-pragmatism)
- [Extreme Ownership](#extreme-ownership)
- [Proactive Collaboration](#proactive-collaboration)
- [Active Pursuit of Mastery](#active-pursuit-of-mastery)
- [Give, Invite, and Act on Feedback](#give-invite-and-act-on-feedback)
- [Create Ecstatic Customers](#create-ecstatic-customers)

#### Relentless Pursuit of Quality with Pragmatism

We hold ourselves to the highest standards of quality, do not compromise long-term for short-term wins, and do not settle for mediocrity.

Quality does not just happen.
It must be pursued, by following the right practices, striving for technical excellence, and by caring for the end users, clients, and our teams.
Our dedication to quality is ingrained in every line of code we write, every design we create, and every solution we deliver, ensuring that our clients receive nothing short of exceptional.

We understand that excellence requires a balance of ambition and practicality, where we strive for perfection without compromising on deliverables.
Our strong bias for action enables us to make the best decisions possible given the information at hand, avoiding analysis paralysis, and continuously delivering value to our clients.

We do strategize, but we also strongly favor execution.
For us, quality is not the destination but rather a continuous journey.

#### Extreme Ownership

We believe in taking complete ownership of our own work, our decisions, and the outcomes.
We don't shy away from challenges or make excuses.
Instead, we take responsibility for both successes and failures, acknowledging that our actions directly impact the results.

We foster a culture of accountability, which demands a proactive and initiative-driven attitude, ensuring that work is not just started but brought to effective closure, without the need for micromanagement or incessant follow-ups.

We lead up, taking ownership of a shared company mission and goals.
We lead down, taking ownership of the success of our team and everyone in it.
We are consultants to our clients, taking ownership of their success.

> "Extreme ownership means taking responsibility for everything in your world. The buck stops with you – always" from the book [Extreme Ownership](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs/dp/1250067057).

#### Proactive Collaboration

Remote work is a team sport, we work together, grow together, and achieve success together.
We actively seek opportunities to collaborate, leveraging the diverse strengths of our team to achieve collective brilliance.

We understand the values of collaborative practices like retrospectives, pair programming, ensembles, root cause analysis, planning, and limiting work-in-progress, and strive to maximize the true essence of the practices to help improve how we work as a team.
We do not make them rote processes.

We create opportunities to collaborate and do not work in silos.
We harness varied perspectives and ensure that every voice is heard and valued.
We know when to say yes and when to say no and can maintain the delicate balance between client and team happiness.

#### Active Pursuit of Mastery

> "ShuHaRi: Follow and ape your hero, break away from their methods, and transcend with yours." - Tao Te Ching

Learning is a lifelong process, integral to both personal and professional growth and we are hungry to learn, striving to get better every single day.
We ask questions and foster an environment of curiosity and innovation.
We believe in the power of inventing and simplifying, constantly aiming for excellence, and staying ahead of industry trends.

Through this active pursuit of mastery, we not only enhance our individual skills but also collectively strengthen our ability to deliver innovative, cutting-edge solutions that consistently exceed client expectations.

We are Craftspeople, we learn from the best in the world, and mastery of our craft is a relentless pursuit.
We are multipliers and share our learnings proactively and freely, taking our peers along with us in our journey to mastery.

We don't tell ourselves and others "That's how things are done here!" Rather, we learn the rules, bend them to move to the next orbit, and master them!

#### Give, Invite, and Act on Feedback

We care enough about our peers to go out of our way to tell them about the things that are holding them back.
Kindness is in embracing the discomfort of giving others feedback.

Our feedback is timely, direct, respectful, and actionable, geared towards the behavior and not the person.
It is also based on trends and not individual instances.
We escalate thoughtfully, after investing enough at a personal level.

While receiving feedback, we listen openly and actively, with a full understanding that the person giving us feedback is investing in our growth.
We take prompt action on the feedback and close the loop as appropriate.

We hold each other to high standards and do not accept mediocrity at work.
We create a safe workspace with no retaliation so that everyone feels safe giving feedback.

"See something, say something." Many times, someone may think, "It's not my place to say something." We not only take accountability ourselves but hold others accountable by giving them timely and direct feedback when we see an opportunity to align them better with our values and guidelines.

#### Create Ecstatic Customers

> "There are only three reasons why software is built: to make money, to save money, or to protect revenue." - Sandro Mancuso

Everything we do is to help our clients succeed.
We are in the business of building dreams.
Our clients trust us to build their dream.
Our goal is to make it a success for them.
Nurture their idea and help it flourish.

Just like we can trust an expert nanny to take care of our kids so that we have the peace of mind to go to work, we are our clients' trusted engineering teams that help free them up to run their businesses.

We build the best software for them, ensuring that the overall vision as well as the minutest details are taken care of.
We care deeply about their needs and have got their backs through thick and thin! Their goals are our goals, and their outcomes are our outcomes.



## RACI matrix

### What is RACI matrix?

The RACI matrix is a responsibility assignment chart that maps out key decisions involved in
completing a project and assigns which roles are Responsible for each action item, which personnel
are Accountable, and, where appropriate, who needs to be Consulted or Informed. The acronym RACI stands for the four
roles that stakeholders might play in any project.

The RACI model brings structure and clarity to describing the roles that stakeholders play within a project.
The RACI matrix clarifies responsibilities and ensures that everything the project needs done is assigned someone
to do it.

The four roles that stakeholders might play in any project include the following:

-   **Responsible**: People or stakeholders who do the work. They must complete the task or objective or make the decision. Several people can be jointly Responsible.
-   **Accountable**: Person or stakeholder who is the “owner” of the work. He or she must sign off or approve when the task, objective or decision is complete. This person must make sure that responsibilities are assigned in the matrix for all related activities. Success requires that there is only one person Accountable, which means that “the buck stops there.”
-   **Consulted**: People or stakeholders who need to give input before the work can be done and signed-off on. These people are “in the loop” and active participants.
-   **Informed**: People or stakeholders who need to be kept “in the picture.” They need updates on progress or decisions, but they do not need to be formally consulted, nor do they contribute directly to the task or decision.
