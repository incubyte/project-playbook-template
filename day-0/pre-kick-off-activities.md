## Kickoff Questionnaire
To start the onboarding process efficiently, it's crucial to collect all necessary information. Strategic questions demonstrate that you're thinking about the big picture, not just providing a one-size-fits-all service. You can achieve this by creating a project kickoff questionnaire using [this](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?origin=NeoPortalPage&lang=en-US&subpage=design&id=JHWwBa_yGkG1qaX-5iKHElej1G4gZDdNveRn3LzXXq1UQUIxOFpBWUIwTjRSWlRQSVBaMFVGWFVFSS4u) template.

### How to use this questionnaire template
- Review all the questions in the questionnaire before generating the survey link. 
- In case of existing clients, you should prefill the questionnaire and get a prefilled URL. 
- In case you want to add questions which are generic enough and are not part of the template, add those questions and update the template. 
- In case some of the questions are not relevant for the current project or you want to add very specific questions, create a duplicate questionnaire. (Click on the 3 dots on the right then click on "Collaborate or duplicate" and get a link to duplicate)

## Kickoff Email
After the questionnaire is prepared, send an email to schedule kickoff call, you can use below email template for reference,
